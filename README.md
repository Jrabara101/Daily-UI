📚 How This Repo Works
Every solution here is a response to a Daily UI Challenge prompt:

Each prompt is its own folder, e.g.,

01-signup-form/

02-credit-card-checkout/

...etc

Source files include both the design and implementation (React, Tailwind, JS, Figma, etc.)

Read the file README in each folder for specific challenge details.
